# Map of Life

## TL;DR
An ever-evolving guide on how to improve your life.

## The Problem
How do I distill, synthesize, and abstract knowledge from courses, podcasts, videos, content, life learnings into concepts, values, and principals?

## Hypotheses
- It's **more valuable** to a reader/consumer to have all the content laid out for you, unlike linear content like YouTube videos and courses.
	- It allows you to *know what you don't know* at very beginning
- Peoples' skills don't all start at 0. Some may get a "higher roll" (to use a game idea) on some skills than others.
	- Learn what you want to learn, skip what you already know
- Distilling ideas will help me (Peter) learn better by essentially trying to teach what I learn.
	- I'll be able to "fit in" new knowledge into the existing concepts
